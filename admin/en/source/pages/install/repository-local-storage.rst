UForge Repository on Local Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..note:: You should only setup UForge repository on local storage if you are installing UForge as a single node environment.

When using local storage, UForge must already be installed, but not configured.  Create two directories one for the operating system data and the other for all the user data (for example ``My Software`` and images generated).

	1. Create the operating system directory, for example: ``/space/DISTROS``
	2. Create the user data directory, for example: ``/space/USER_DATA``
